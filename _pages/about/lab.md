Welcome to Robot Intelligence Learning & System Lab!

The Robot Intelligence Learning & System (RILS) Lab is dedicated to developing advanced robotic **perception**, **adaptation**, and **decision-making** technologies grounded in **deep learning vision** and **reinforcement learning**. Our mission is to create robotic systems that intelligently perceive their surroundings, adapt to dynamic environments, and autonomously learn to make optimal decisionsâ€”ultimately driving innovation in areas such as autonomous robots, unmanned vehicles, and intelligent automation systems.
